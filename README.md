# OIBSIP-PYTHONPROGRAMMING-TASK2
This Python program is a BMI Calculator with a GUI built using Tkinter. It calculates BMI, shows the health category, and saves records in an SQLite . Users can view their BMI history in a table and analyze trends . Each entry is stored with the username, weight, height, and date. It helps users track and visualize their BMI progress over time.

Objective:
To develop a GUI-based BMI Calculator that computes, stores, and tracks users’ BMI records with history and trend analysis.

Steps Performed:
Designed the GUI using Tkinter for user input and display.
Calculated BMI and determined the health category.
Stored BMI data in an SQLite database.
Displayed history using Treeview and trend graph using Matplotlib.

Tools Used:
Python, Tkinter, SQLite, Matplotlib, Datetime library.

Outcome:
A functional application that calculates BMI, saves user data, and visually shows BMI history and trends over time.
